Description: Maximum likelihood estimation for univariate reducible
 stochastic differential equation models. Discrete, possibly noisy
 observations, not necessarily evenly spaced in time. Can fit
 multiple individuals/units with global and local parameters, by
 fixed-effects or mixed-effects methods. Ref.: Garcia, O. (2019)
